# rust_guess_fruit_game

This game is made using rustc language.

<h1 >Guess the correct fruit to win!! <h1>

To win this game you have to guess the correct fruit.

You will get the list of fruits.

If you enter something that is not in the list then you will get a warning of "Invalid Input" .. Here, No Pain, No Gain , i.e you neither win nor lose.

If failed in guessing, you will have 2 consecutive chances, i.e. if you lose consecutively 3 times then you finally lose.

I said "consecutively", e.g. if you lose 2 times, you will have a final chance, but if you manage to guess the correct fruit this time, you will get the lose counter reset, i.e you will get 3 consecutive chances.

Everytime you win, you get your lose counter reset.
